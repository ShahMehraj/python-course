You want to **delete only the `.csv` files**.\n\n* **Using GUI:** You’d scroll, search, and manually select hundreds of CSVs — time-consuming and prone to mistakes.\n* **Using CLI:** One simple command removes all `.csv` files at once:\n\n```bash\nrm *.csv\n```\n\n🧠 This instantly deletes only the files ending in `.csv`, without touching anything else — clean, fast, and accurate.\n\n\n---\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🧾 Another Way to Talk to Computers: **Code**\n\nJust like humans use different **languages** to communicate — like English, Hindi, French, or Spanish — we use different **programming languages** to communicate with computers.\n\nSome common ones are **C, C++, Java, Python, PHP**, and many more. Each has its own style and purpose, but they all help us **give instructions to the computer**.\n\n---\n\n### 🤖 What is Code?\n\nCode is a set of instructions written in a programming language. It tells the computer **what to do** and **how to do it**.\n\n🧠 *Analogy:* Think of code as a **recipe**. A chef follows a recipe to cook a dish, and similarly, a computer follows code to perform a task — like solving a problem, processing data, or showing something on the screen.\n\n---\n\n### 🐍 Why Python?\n\nIn this lecture, we’ll use **Python**, one of the most popular and beginner-friendly languages.\n\n* 🧠 **Simple and easy to understand** — like reading English\n* 🔧 Used in **AI, data science, automation, web development**, and more\n* 🚀 Great for **beginners** but powerful enough for big companies like Google and NASA\n\n#### 👉 Example:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n```\n\n🗣️ This tells the computer to display the message **Hello, world!** — just like saying “Hi!” to your machine.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🧠 A Quick Note About Memory\n\nBefore we start writing Python code, it’s important to understand a basic concept: **memory**.\n\nComputers, like humans, need a place to **store information** while working.
